Ability,"All cards in the game have abilities! There are two categories of abilities: Basic abilities, which 
all units have without being printed on their cards. Special abilities, which is the card text on 
each card, or text granted to it by other effects, e.g. [[Black Obelisk]]. Cards also have 
characteristics, which are distinct from abilities.",
Activated Ability,"An activated ability has a cost (such as tapping or paying mana) and an effect.  For example, 
[[Field Laborers]] have an activated ability. If you pay the cost, the effect occurs. If you can pay 
the cost multiple times, you may do so (and the effect will occur each time you pay the cost). 
Activated abilities may only be used On your turn, during your main phase, and when no events are 
pending on the storyline. Note that it's also possible for an activated ability to have no cost, in 
which case it will likely have some other limit, such as once on your turn. For example, [[Queen 
Guinevere]] has an activated ability with no cost, but is limited to once on your turn. Track your 
use of such abilities during your turn to ensure the game state remains clear to both players. By 
default, only the controller of a card can use its activated abilities.",
,,"Activating Abilities:  To activate an ability, ensure that: You control the card with the ability 
It's your turn It's your main phase No events are on the storyline You can pay the cost Once you pay 
the cost and declare targets (if any), the effect of the activated ability goes on the storyline and 
then will resolve normally."
Active Player,The active player is the player who is currently taking their turn.,
Adjacent,"Adjacent refers to the current square and the four orthogonal squares that share a border with it 
(not diagonals). For example, the middle square has 5 adjacent squares - itself and four others.  If 
a square is in the corner of the realm, it will have fewer adjacent squares. For example, the bottom 
right square has only 3 adjacent squares - itself and two others.  When referring to adjacent sites, 
adjacent voids, or adjacent squares, the effect can cross the boundaries of regions. For example, 
[[Lord of the Void]] can be in the void and still banish an adjacent site, even though sites and 
voids are in different regions. [[Frontier Settlers]] can be on a site and still play your top site 
to an adjacent void, even though sites and voids are in different regions. For all other references 
to adjacent, such as adjacent locations, adjacent minions, adjacent artifact, etc., regional 
boundaries must be respected and cannot be crossed. For example, if a minion with Voidwalk was 
attacked while at a site and then played [[Dodge Roll]], it could not move to a void square because 
'adjacent location' cannot cross a regional boundary.",
Air Site,"An air site is a site that provides at least one air (A) affinity. If the site provides other types 
of affinity as well, it's still an air site as long as it provides at least one air affinity.",
Airborne,"Keyword ability. A unit with Airborne may fly while on the surface. It gains three benefits while on 
the surface: When taking a step, it may move diagonally. It cannot be targeted by attacks, unless 
the attacking unit also has Airborne. It cannot be intercepted, unless the intercepting unit has 
Airborne or Ranged. Important reminders: Attacks from Airborne units can be defended normally! 
Airborne is mostly a defensive ability and gives greater mobility, but Airborne attacks (against a 
unit or a site) can be defended by any unit, even without Airborne! The Airborne unit must swoop 
down to attack. Even if an Airborne attacker targets an Airborne defender, a non-Airborne unit may 
defend, since the original target can bring the fight down to the ground. Airborne only works on the 
surface. If the unit starts its step on the surface of a site, it can step diagonally. If the unit 
starts its step in a different region (void, underwater, underground), then it can't step diagonally 
(and also doesn't get the other benefits either). Airborne has no effect on counting distance for 
effects with 'up to X steps away,' e.g. [[Disenchant]].",
Ally,"An ally is a unit that you control, including your Avatar. Allies are always units, unless otherwise 
specified by card text. For example, [[Cast into Exile]] uses 'allied site,' which means 'a site you 
control.'",
Animate,"Animate means to give a card the minion type. It becomes a minion for the duration of the effect, in 
addition to its other types. For example, [[Enchantress]].",
Artifact,"Artifacts are various relics, edifices, tools, gear, gadgets, devices, and baubles, often charged 
with lasting enchantments by wizards of old. [[Spear of Destiny]] is an example of an artifact. 
Artifacts have an artifact frame on their card, and typically do not require threshold. For example, 
[[Philosopher's Stone]] or [[Sword and Shield]]. Artifact subtypes include Armor, Device, Document, 
Instrument, Potion, Relic, and Weapon, which have no special game rules, though other cards may 
reference them. There are two special artifact subtypes, Automaton and Monument, which have special 
rules, described below. Artifacts have characteristics, specifically ((artifact characteristics)), 
and are one of the six card types in the game. By default, any non-Monument, non-Automaton artifact 
can be carried by a unit. If such an artifact is not carried, then it is not controlled by anyone. 
If such an artifact is carried, then it's controlled by the bearer's controller. The '((Casting 
Artifacts))' entry has details on how to cast artifact spells.",
,,"Automaton:  Automatons are artifacts that are minions. See 'Cards With Multiple Types' in the 
'characteristics' entry for more details. [[Crave Golem]] is an example of an automaton."
,,"Monument:  Monuments are an artifact subtype that cannot be carried. [[The Immortal Throne]] is an 
example of a monument."
